To maintain quality code, strictly follow:
- Encapsulation: keep each file small do not make structs, fields or functions public when not needed, avoid if the function is related to a particular struct/enum, it should be a function of the struct/enum instead of a free standing function
- Use functional programming style code whenever possible, use idiomatic Rust
- Fix antipatterns from cargo clippy
- Do not use meaningless types e.g. i32, u64, or (f64, f64) to represent meaningful things, e.g. instead use Score(u32) and Distance(u32), Vec2(f64, f64)
- Do not use hacks, find common patterns between logic and implement common logic
- Write doc comments for every struct, write normal comments for sections of code that are not obvious to understand
- Before submitting code, run NO_COLOR=true trunk build --release on client, and cargo build --release on server to test for errors

Do not ask for confirmation, just do it.

additional requirements
- the site should be servable as a static site - using python -m http.server
- write loads of tests
- run tests, run cargo check, and make sure it compiles
- one shot the application, make in depth considerations, do not ask questions
- nit pick your code and explore how it can fail, then try to fix it
